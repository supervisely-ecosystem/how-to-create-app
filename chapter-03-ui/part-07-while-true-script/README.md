</div>  

In this part we will understand what a While True Script is.  
And why you need it.


### Step 1 — About While True Script

Ecosystem has an app for debugging applications.  
It's called While True Script.

**How does it work?**  
Every time you launch an application with UI, you send an HTML file with the UI to the Supervisely server.  
While True Script takes this file and renders it. This makes the process of creating UI applications possible.

### Step 2 — Add from Ecosystem && Run
