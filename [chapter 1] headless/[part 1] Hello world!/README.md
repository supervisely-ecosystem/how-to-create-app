## **Part 1 — Hello world! [From your Python script to Supervisely APP]**  
<br/>
</div>


In this part, we will show you how you can turn any Python code into a Supervisely application.


### Step 1 — Python code


Let's start with a simple python code.  
At Supervisely, we try to think **big** — so let's say hello to multiple worlds at once.

-main.py code [part 1]-


### Step 2 — Configuration file


Config file. **We**. **Need**. **It**.  
To add a Python application to Supervisely, let's create a configuration file for it. An example of a config file:

-config.json file example  [part 1]-


### Step 3 — Create repository


We've almost reached the finish line!
In this step, we create a repository and add our code to it.

There are simple [instructions here](https://docs.supervise.ly/enterprise-edition/advanced-tuning/private-apps).

If the application is not displayed in Private apps, then you should check Refresh Ecosystem Log (in Tasks).


### Step 4 — Run our app and check output!

 Let's take a look at the results of our efforts. Done!
