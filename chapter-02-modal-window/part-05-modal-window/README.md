## **Part 5 ‚Äî Modal window [What is it?]**  
<br/>
</div>  

The modal window in Supervisely appears after clicking on the launch button of the application.
It can be used for at least two things:

1. **to inform the user**
2. **to enter arguments**

In this part, we will create a basic application with modal window.  
We will use the modal window as an **information board**.

### Step 1 ‚Äî HTML file

We use HTML to create the UI.

üìù **you can preview your HTML in [our Application Designer](https://app.supervise.ly/apps/designer)**

Here's our modal window:


**src/modal.html**  
```HTML
<div>
    <h3>This is my first modal window app.</h3>
</div>
```

Simple. Isn't?  
Now let's add it to our config file:


**config.json**  
```json
{
  "name": "Modal Window",
  "type": "app",
  "categories": [
    "quickstart"
  ],
  "description": "There will be some description",
  "docker_image": "supervisely/base-py-sdk:6.1.93",
  "main_script": "chapter-02-headless/part-05-modal-window/src/main.py",
  "modal_template": "chapter-02-headless/part-05-modal-window/src/modal.html",
  "task_location": "workspace_tasks",
  "icon": "https://img.icons8.com/color/100/000000/5.png",
  "icon_background": "#FFFFFF"
}

```

### Step 2 ‚Äî Results

Let's add the application to the Supervisely and see the result.  
`screenshots/demo`  
It works.
